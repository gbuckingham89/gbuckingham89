# Hello, I'm George 👋

I'm a senior PHP / Laravel developer based in Bournemouth, UK 🏖☀️.

I've built web based software:

* 🛒 That sells products in a B2B environment with a large catalogue, complex buying rules and several 3rd party integrations (Laravel)
* 📊 To manage the scheduling of staff & provide financial insights for an international VFX company (Laravel)
* 🗺 That analyses every plot of land in England & Wales for potential residential development (PostGIS, Laravel, Vue.js, Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS)
* ☎️ To manage the workload across two call centres for an insurance company (Laravel)
* 📹 That delivers video-based online training programs (Laravel, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel Livewire)
* 🎓 To provide a browser based learning platform for children with 2-way video conferencing (Vue.js SPA)
* 🛥 That manages maintenance programs onboard luxury motor boats (Bespoke PHP)
* 🛍 To sell a range of niche products internationally (Laravel)
* 🚐 That manages the stock for a large retailer of luxury motorhomes (Bespoke PHP & WordPress integration)

Away from coding, I love to travel ✈️, cycle 🚴‍♂️ and spend time outdoors 🏕.
